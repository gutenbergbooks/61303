  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the previous pamphlets, “English Methods of Birth
Control” and “Dutch Methods of Birth Control,” one finds a
duplication of the methods given in the first pamphlet, “Family
Limitation.” The French methods of Birth Control are so
nearly the same that I have decided not to duplicate these
again, but to give instead a list of the books and pamphlets
issued by the French League, and also cuts or pictures of some
of the articles they have for sale at their headquarters, 27 Rue
de la Duée, Paris. These will be found at the end of this
pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c006'>I also find that the methods used to control births in
Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, India, Russia,
and Japan have all been greatly influenced by the English and
Dutch Neo-Malthusian Leagues (the two oldest Leagues). To
give further national methods would be only a waste of time and
material, and would add nothing to what has already been given.
This does not mean that there are not many other mechanical
devices. There are numerous ones; but I still find that there is
nothing better, safer, cheaper, or more convenient than the
pessary mentioned in “Family Limitation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Sweden
there are strong Neo-Malthusian movements advancing the Birth
Control theories by lectures, literature, and practical means. In
Russia, Japan, India, and United States there have been recently
feeble attempts to establish Birth Control movements; but as
yet they have remained embryonic.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have decided to close this series of pamphlets with the
following explanation of the Magnetation method, and feel that
I have said all that I can say of interest on Birth Control
methods. I have gladly donated my mite toward what I
consider essential to woman’s economic, social, and sexual
freedom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>Magnetation Method of Birth Control.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Before closing this series of pamphlets on the practical
methods of Birth Control, I feel in justice to the many readers
and subscribers of the <i>Woman Rebel</i> who inquired about the
theories of Magnetation, Male Continence, Sedular Absorption,
Karezza, and Zugassent’s Discovery, that this series would not
be complete without giving at least a general idea of these
theories and their practice.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is interesting to note that the magnetation theory had
its best and longest practice, as well as its beginning, in America,
under the title Male Continence. This method was practised for
over forty years by a group averaging 130 men and 150 women
known as the Oneida Community. They occupied a part of the
old reservation of the Oneida Indians in New York State, and
lived in a harmonious and prosperous form of Communistic
society. John Humphrey Noyes was the head and founder of
the group. Through personal experience and prolonged study, he
discovered the theory of male continence. Since that time many
others have come forward with the <i>same theory</i> under various
names. Almost without exception, each advocate has injected
some kind of religion into it. The Oneida Community was
particularly a religious sect, and Alice B. Stockham, the author of
Karezza, was a fervent religionist. However, aside from this,
there are fundamental truths in the theory which bear thinking
about and should not be discarded without some consideration.
In view of the thousands of testimonials of the healthful results
of the practice of these theories, I present these methods like that
of the others, and for convenience shall classify them all under
one head, “Magnetation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There are thousands of men and women who object to the
practical and mechanical means of Birth Control, who feel that
the pessary, condom, and douche are gross and sordid, and take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>away the artistic and spiritual beauty of the act. It is those
whom the magnetation method will interest most. There are
others who will claim that this method is “not satisfying,” and
can find no enjoyment in its practice. But so are there thousands
of men and women who can pass a beautiful painting and receive
no inspiration from it, or listen to a charming selection on a
musical instrument and receive no emotion from it. So are there
many whose natures are not so constructed that they can enjoy
or benefit by this method. There is no doubt that the successful
attainment of this method is dependable upon a fine spiritual
bond between the two who enjoy its practice.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE THEORY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The advocates of the magnetation method ask you to first
analyse sexual intercourse. They claim that you will recognise in
it two distinct acts, <i>i.e.</i>, the social (or amative) and the propagative.
Those who practise the magnetation method content themselves
with and prefer the social act, unless the procreative act is desired.
It is usually held that the sexual organs have <i>two</i> distinct
functions, viz., the urinary and the propagative. The advocates
of the magnetation theory claim that the sexual organs have <i>three</i>
distinct functions, viz., urinary, propagative, and amative—<i>i.e.</i>,
they are conductors firstly of urine, secondly of semen, and
thirdly of social magnetism. Each one separate and distinct in
itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>The organs of propagation are physiologically distinct from
the organs of union in both sexes. The testicles are the principal
organs of reproduction in the male, and the uterus in the female.
Sexual conjunction of male and female no more involves the
discharge of semen than of the urine. The discharge of semen,
instead of being the main act of sexual intercourse, is really the
sequel and termination of it. Sexual intercourse pure and simple
is the conjunction of the organs of union, and the interchange
and flow of magnetic influences through that conjunction. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>seminal discharge can be voluntarily withheld in sexual intercourse,
or it can be produced without sexual intercourse, as in
masturbation, which demonstrates the fact that the discharge of
the semen, and the pleasure associated with its discharge, is not
social, since it can be produced in solitude: it is a personal and
not a social act.</p>

<p class='c006'>The physiological analysis of the procreative act shows that
the pleasure of the act is not produced by contact and interchange
of life with the female, but by the action of the seminal fluid on
the internal nerves of the male organ. The desire and that
which satisfies it are both within the man, and may be obtained
without sexual intercourse. The amative function, or the simple
union of two persons, is a distinct and independent function,
giving a medium of magnetic interchange superior to that gained
through the reproductive function. It is the presence of the
seed and not the absence of it that makes the bull superior to the
ox, and it is the stimulating, retaining, and absorbing the semen
in the man, and directing it into other creative channels, which
make the amative act of greater benefit and more healthful and
vitalising than the procreative act.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of us know that creative energy expressed through the
sexual nature is an instinct to perpetuate life; that it has its
origin in and is co-existent with life itself; that it is the power
back of all purposes and plans; that it is the self-pushing force
that gives the individual the ability and desire to do and to
perform; that it is the impelling factor and inventive genius in
all man’s handiwork. That this force operates in the multiplication
of atoms and molecules, in the attraction of germ to
sperm cells. The process of growth and fulfilment of functions
is propelled by this energy, which is operative throughout all
Nature. It is the force back of and expresses itself through the
physical life of man and animal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Atoms, cells, and plants are unconscious of this force, and
animals are conscious of it only in a slight degree. But man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>conscious of this energy, and is capable of developing a greater
consciousness of it and of its operation and utilisation to a
remarkable degree. Like the engineer who masters the engine
by his knowledge of its construction and the force that runs it, so
can man master this creative energy and direct it where he wills.
Creative life can be expressed in other ways beside parenthood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Emerson says, “Work your passion up into poetry.” Passion
is the sign of creative power; it is the voice of creative life. If
it were understood and its powers realised, it would be elevated
and worshipped instead of lowered and debased, as the Comstocks
would have us do. As creative energy becomes understood and
applied, men and women will grow in strength of character and
in strength of love, and will naturally devote these powers to the
interests and development of the human race.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE PRACTICE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Each of these theories involves sedular absorption through
intercourse without culmination. No discharge is allowed, but
by a superior control is retained, thereby making the act an
amative (love) act, and uplifting it from an exhaustive, abrupt
fertilising function into a quiet magnetic charm, producing health
and increased happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>The act of sexual intercourse has a beginning, a middle, and
an end. Its beginning or first stage is simply the presence of the
male organ in the female. The middle or second stage is a series
of reciprocal motions. The end or third stage is the ejaculatory
crisis, or the termination of the act. The advocates of male
continence, Zugassent’s discovery, sedular absorption, and
magnetation claim that the whole process up to the third stage
is entirely voluntary and can be stopped at any point. It is
compared to a stream in the three conditions of a fall, a course of
rapids above the fall, and still water above the rapids. The
boatman may decide if he will remain in still water or venture
down the rapids, or run his boat over the fall. They contend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>that experience will teach him the wisdom of remaining where
the rowing is easy, unless the object is worthy of going over the
falls. Karezza advises to content oneself with simple presence in
the first stage until the magnetic thrill passes off. They are all
similar and all aim at the same result. I head them under one
method—“magnetation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Those who practise it claim the highest possible enjoyment,
with no loss of vitality and a perfect control of the fecundating
power. Its practice greatly involves the art of love by a prolonged
intercourse preventing that which puts an end to intercourse—the
ejaculation. The seminal fluid, it is claimed, has an immense
immanent value; and if kept in the system and magnetised, and
reabsorbed by the blood, adds enormously to a man’s mental and
magnetic force, which through the ordinary sexual act is constantly
being expended. That its practice by some men will be
difficult there can be no doubt; but it can be no more difficult or
need a greater power of control than that required of the man in
the act of “coitus interruptus” (withdrawal). Those who practise
magnetation claim that it is far removed from “repelling
asceticism”; that it gives ample exercise to the affections, and
opportunity for the exchange of sexual magnetism; but that its
greatest benefit is that its practice conduces to a higher love
development. It is the attainment of this control that raises
the sexual passion in man and woman to its proper place by
the side of music and poetry.</p>

<p class='c006'>The strongest objection which is put forth against its practice
is that it is “unnatural”; that it is unauthorised by the examples
of other creatures of the animal kingdom, and therefore must be
wrong. But the answer comes that cooking, wearing clothes, and
all modern life is far removed from natural living; and were we
to remain in close adherence to Nature, we would go on all fours
and remain dumb.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we realise we are living in an age when nearly all
departments of life have been greatly modified and advanced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>recent discoveries of steam, electricity, the telephone, telegraphy,
the microscope, and other agents of enlightenment, is it not
surprising that there has been almost no discovery or improvement
in the vital department of the sex relations? The explorer,
the pioneer, the discoverer may pursue his way into every
department of life, and return to lay his riches at the feet of
Science, Art, or Invention; but woe to him who dares to explore
that shaded valley of sex. No matter how pure the motive, or
what agony and miseries one sought to alleviate, dungeons,
persecutions, slanders, and jails await him who ventures to bring
treasures from its hidden depths. Yet there is no other department
of life which needs so much instruction and education as
the sex department.</p>

<p class='c006'>A healthful sexual stimulation has a beneficial effect on both
men and women, especially when the loved one is accessible and
some demonstration of sexual feeling allowed, as in the restrained
yet ardent caresses of an affianced pair. Here we often see not
only the happiest but the most productive and healthful period of
a man’s life. It is said this is particularly true of man’s
intellectual activities.</p>

<p class='c006'>We see a year later this same happy pair experience a great
falling off in their affection. Women have experienced this so
often that they begin to hate the sexual relation, and look upon
the act either with fear of pregnancy or with an unconquerable
loathing. Of course, a great deal of this aversion which women
experience is the result of their former training. The girl is
taught before marriage that the act is a most degrading thing,
and is told that it is the accomplishment of this one thing for
which man desires her before marriage. Afterwards all is
supposed to be changed. She is expected to have an entirely
new philosophy as soon as the marriage certificate is in her hands.
The average young man knows little of the art of love, and is
consequently unable to beautify their relations or to teach her a
new psychology. The first year is spent in secret misery on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>side, and ruptures and misunderstandings between them both.
The average woman will tell you she loves to be caressed and to
express her affection for her husband, but could be quite satisfied
without intercourse. This is especially true of the intellectual
woman, who is acknowledging her lessening interest in the sex
relation, and even repulses affectionate demonstration, fearing it
must terminate in sexual intercourse (mainly the fear of
pregnancy).</p>

<p class='c006'>Surely this is something to be squarely faced by every
intelligent man and woman, and serious enough to deserve our
untiring interest. Something must be wrong. What is it?
Does this theory offer a solution to any? It may. Nearly all
women who practise it testify to its benefits, while few men complain
of it. Those who do, say that to control the ejaculation to-day
means a seminal loss later during sleep. The advocates, however,
say this will occur at first, but after the organs become accustomed
to their new function this will wear off, and there will be no
seminal loss.</p>

<p class='c006'>All men in the Oneida community realised that this control
was a necessary attainment if they would be regarded with favor
by the women in the group. Its accomplishment was necessary
to their mutual happiness, and they had to learn it. If there is
a method which in practice expresses the highest mutual affection
and reveals one’s own strength and power, then by all means let
mankind know it.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no earthly reason why men and women should not
study the laws of sex expression as any other science is studied,
and it should be a study not only intellectual, but of experience
and adjustment. If, as is claimed, the experience of this method
must be practised on a higher plane of thought than the purely
physical, then certainly it must tend toward a finer companionship
and understanding between men and women than the fleeting
physical gratification prevailing at present. If there is anything
which controverts the traditional uncleanliness previously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>attached to the sex relation, if there is anything which brings
a blending of body and spirit or an ennoblement of the character
of the individual, then by all means let us have it in its fullest
detail, and let this revolting ignorance and prudery holding sway
over men and women’s minds so long be swept away for all time.
Let us have light, through discussion, experience, and adjustment.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are few men who desire to expose the object of their
affection to the burden of bearing children faster than her health
will permit. They realise a woman’s strength is greatly undermined
and her beauty and grace fast ebbing away; but ignorance
and tradition have him in their grip. He knows nothing about
the means to prevent it, and allows the one he loves best to
wither and fade before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is especially necessary for the woman to be free from the
mental dread of pregnancy. There is nothing so productive of
nervous disorders or so likely to decrease the sexual attraction or
magnetation as fear and anxious thought. Perfect confidence in
the man’s ability to control himself is essential to the perfection
and desired results of these methods. Just as one begins, so can
one develop. Young men and women about to enter alliances
and desirous to establish a lasting affection and higher bond
between themselves can easily put this method into practice and
control the sex functions. The more magnetic the individual, the
greater the sex attractions between those who love, and the
stronger the bond will grow between them, through this
“magnetation” method.</p>

<p class='c006'>The expression and adjustment of all theories is so largely
personal that special regulations can scarcely be given. The road
to science and the great natural laws are discovered through
experience: there is no education but that of experience.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>TESTED THEORIES AND PRACTICAL TRUTHS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>From Those Who Have Practised This Method.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>I am a young man twenty-four years of age, enjoying the
most vigorous health. For two years after becoming engaged I
delayed marriage, simply because I did not think my income
sufficient to support a wife and the children which I regarded as
an inevitable consequence. Happily for me, a friend who knew
my circumstances wrote me about male continence. The ideas
contained in this discovery were so different from all my preconceived
ideas of what constituted marital happiness that I was
inclined to reject them as utterly impracticable and absurd. But
the more I thought of the matter, the more clearly I saw that if
there was a possibility of these new ideas being true, they were
exactly adapted to a man in my circumstances, and that they
made my marriage immediately practicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wholly new thought, that retaining the vital seminal
secretion in the body, instead of spending it recklessly, might
make a man stronger, cleaner, and better, also seemed to me not
irrational. With some misgivings, therefore, I ventured upon
marriage; and, thanks to this practice, it has been found a
complete success. I have had a continuous honeymoon for four
years, besides having the daily use of my wife’s invaluable
services in my business, and have never been conscious of any
irksome constraint or asceticism in my sexual experience, and my
self-control and strength, mental and physical, have greatly
increased since my marriage. In the light of my own experience,
I regard the idea that the seminal fluid is a secretion that must
be got rid of as being the most pernicious and fatal one that can
possibly be taught to young people.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>From a Man of Seventy.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>My age is seventy years, and, thanks to male continence, my
health is good and I am as vigorous sexually as I ever was. My
only regret is that I was not informed of it earlier in life. It is
not only a splendid sanitary measure, but is a promoter of
pleasure and the greatest harmoniser of domestic life that I
know. It is my decided opinion that where this practice is
adhered to, except where reproduction is desired, strife and
contention, separation and divorce would never occur. It seems
to me that no one who is seeking improvement would, after
experiencing this practice, ever wish to go back to the crude
sensual practice in whose wake follow satiety, exhaustion, disgust,
and remorse.</p>

<p class='c006'>The waste of vital and nerve force attending the usual
custom of intercourse is, in my opinion, a leading cause of the
craving for alcohol and tobacco; while in this new practice both
parties, if magnetism exists, experience a renewal of life force
that is in the highest degree wholesome. If young men would
abide by this practice they would find that their self-control
would be immensely enhanced in every department of life, and
that they would retain the vigor and enjoyment of their sexual
nature long after the generality of men have become impotent.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>From a Woman.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>Since my husband became acquainted with this new theory
he has endeared himself to me a hundredfold; and although our
so-called “honeymoon” was passed five years ago, it was no more
real and far less lasting than the ecstatic, the unspeakable
happiness which is now continually mine. My prosaic and
sometimes indifferent husband has changed by a heavenly magic
into an ardent and entrancing lover, for whose coming I watch
with all the tender raptures of a schoolgirl. His very step sends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a thrill through me, for I know that my beloved will clasp me in
his arms and cover me with kisses, such as only the most
enthusiastic lover could give. And though the years lapse, I
cannot see or feel any change in the way he cherishes me. To
each other we are continually objects of the deepest reverence
and the most sacred mystery. Our affection deepens, our
romance seems as sure and as enduring as the stars. I date my
marriage from the time that he became a student of Zugassent,
for that was the beginning of our assured happiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is not alone as a cherishing lover that my husband
has become the crown of my happiness. He has grown perceptibly
nobler in character, in purpose, and in strength; so that
besides a lover I have a strong friend, a wise councillor, and my
happiness is complete.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>A Husband of Fifteen Years.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>It gives me happiness to testify to the beneficial effects of
this method, because I am earnestly convinced that no other
discovery in physical science has ever been made which is of such
importance to the welfare of the human race. In proportion as I
have followed this method life has become wholesome and happy.
It avoids the opposite evils of asceticism and self-indulgence, and
does more than <i>any other single thing</i> to make the marriage
relation a perpetual courtship. I am a husband of fifteen years,
and speak of matters that I know.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>A Letter to J. H. Noyes.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>This Yankee nation claims to be a nation of inventors, but
the discovery of male continence puts you, in my mind, at the
head of all inventors. There has been no higher conservation of
force than that realised by this method, and I am confident that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the blessings which will flow from it cannot be measured by those
which have followed the steam engine and the electric telegraph.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>A Friend.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>A school friend of mine who lived in a large manufacturing
town in New York State, and has been married five years, had
learned during the first months of marriage this method of birth
control. She was radiant with happiness; did not desire a child
until they had made provision for the future. Husband worked
ten hours in the electrical works, after which he played a cornet
in a concert, which kept him until after midnight every night.
Such long hours of labor would deplete and exhaust the average
man, but this fellow was as radiant and strong as one could
picture. Both claimed it is the practice of this method to which
they owe their health, strength, and happiness.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><span class='sc'>A Grandmother.</span></h3>

<p class='c008'>A grandmother came from San Francisco to assist at the
birth of a grandchild. Had been married thirty-five years, but
looked like a girl of twenty-eight in figure and color. I was
amazed at the vivacity and eagerness and joyous health of this
woman. Every day she received one or two letters from her
husband, who had remained in San Francisco; and from part of
them which she read to me one would think he was some ardent
and forlorn lover of eighteen. She claimed she had always
practised this method, and knew of a few others who practised
it, and found its practice superior to any other. She was the
most beautiful sexually alive woman I have ever known, and the
most modest. “True modesty is a sentiment which springs, not
from indifference or aversion to the sexual offices, but from a
delicate and reverent appreciation of their value.”</p>
